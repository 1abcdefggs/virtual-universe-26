# Issue to PR

Turn one open issue into a suggested fix that a person reviews. These are the
same `gh` commands you ran by hand in Section 1.

1. Confirm the learner's fork target and push remote established in this
   session. Inspect `git remote -v`, verify the selected destination with
   `gh repo view <fork-url> --json nameWithOwner,parent`, and confirm ownership or
   write access. Origin may still be the event repository. Use
   `GH_REPO=<verified-owner/repo>` for every GitHub CLI operation and push only to
   the explicitly verified fork remote, never implicitly to origin.
   - If no fork destination is ready, stop before edits or resource creation.
     Offer to prepare it in this same checkout with approval, preserving origin,
     other remotes, and local work. Do not open or switch sessions.
2. Pick the issue. Use the number you were given, or list open issues and ask:
   `gh issue list --state open`
3. Read the issue and the code it mentions: `gh issue view <n>`
4. Create a branch: `git switch -c fix/issue-<n>`
5. Make the smallest change that fixes the issue, and run the project's tests
   if it has any.
   - When a fix needs library or API documentation, use the Context7 Expert
     agent and Context7 MCP connector to look it up. Send only public
     documentation queries, not repository contents. Cite relevant sources
     in the draft PR. If the agent or connector is unavailable, report it
     instead of claiming the lookup succeeded.
6. Show the changes and obtain approval. Then commit only the files you changed
   for this issue, push the branch to the verified fork remote, and open a draft
   pull request that closes the issue:
   `gh pr create --draft --title "Fix #<n>: <issue title>" --body "<body>"`
   Start the body with "Closes #<n>", then add a short summary and a
   "How to test" section with the exact commands a reviewer can run. When
   Context7 documentation informed the fix, include its relevant source links.
   Preserve any learner skill edits and include them only with approval.
7. Ask before commenting on the issue with what changed and how to test it.
   Report the exact issue, PR, and branch. Leave this PR branch checked out so
   the learner can review it in the same session; do not switch branches.

## Rules

- Never merge, approve, or close anything. A person reviews the pull request.
- If the fix is unclear, comment on the issue with your questions instead of guessing.
- Stage only the files you changed for this issue.
