Use `--attach` to add a screenshot to an issue, straight from the terminal.

> **Note**
>
> Mona's café tests its menu site with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev),
> a browser automation tool. In an automated workflow, Playwright opens the
> site in a headless browser on every pull request, clicks through each page,
> checks what it sees and saves screenshots when something looks wrong. On its
> last run it caught every price on the menu showing `$NaN` and saved
> [`menu-prices.png`](menu-prices.png).
>
> You'll file that bug with the screenshot attached, without leaving the
> terminal. A workflow can run the same `gh issue create --attach` command to
> report failures on its own.

## Before you start (skip if you already signed in on Section 1)

To copy a command, hover over its code block and click the copy button at the
top right. Paste it into the terminal at the bottom of your Codespace and press
<kbd>Enter</kbd>. If the terminal isn't open, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>`</kbd>.

Sign in to GitHub:

```bash
unset GH_TOKEN GITHUB_TOKEN
gh auth login --hostname github.com --git-protocol https --web
```

Finish authorizing in the browser and wait for the terminal prompt to return.
Then create your fork and make it the target for issues and pull requests:

```bash
gh auth setup-git &&
gh repo fork --remote &&
gh repo set-default "$(git remote get-url origin)" &&
gh repo edit --enable-issues
```

After signing in, follow the steps below by copying and pasting the commands
below into your terminal.

## 1. Go to this folder

```bash
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
cd 01-github-latest-features/attach-images-to-an-issue
```

## 2. Create an issue with the screenshot

The text after `#` is the image's alt text.

```bash
url=$(gh issue create \
  --title "Menu prices show \$NaN" \
  --body "Playwright caught this:" \
  --attach 'menu-prices.png#Menu board showing $NaN') &&
printf '\n\033[1mYour issue: %s\033[0m\n\n' "$url"
```

## 3. Open your issue

Open the bold **Your issue** link the terminal prints. The screenshot is in
the issue.

> **Tip**
>
> `--attach` also works with `gh issue comment` and `gh pr create`.

## What you'll attach
